        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I am 19 years old and go to Algonquin college. I have 2 jobs and I am a very busy person but I still need a life outside for work and school so I enjoy going to social events when I am not as busy. I have a frenchton named Tony and a cat named
            Finch. They are little menaces but they are my sweet little babies.</p>
        <p>I am someone who enjoys EDM, coding, arts, volunteering, movie night and getting baked with my mom. I may not get to enjoy everything as often due to a busy schedule but these things definitely keep me more content.</p>
