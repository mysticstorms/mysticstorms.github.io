                <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am M and I am 19 years old and this is my 1<sup>st</sup> year at Algonquin college. I have 2 jobs and I am a very busy person but I still need a life outside of work and school. So I enjoy going to social events when I am not as busy. I have a frenchton named Tony and a cat named Finch. They are little menaces but they are my sweet little babies.</p>

                    <p>I am someone who enjoys EDM, coding, arts, volunteering, movie night and getting baked with my mom. I may not get to enjoy everything as often due to a busy schedule but these things definitely keep me more content. I just try to see the world in a positive way cause if you don't then life for me gets harder.</p>
