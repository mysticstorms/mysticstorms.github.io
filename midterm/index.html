                    <p>Katsuki Bakugo is a student at U.A. High School training to become a Pro Hero. Known for his explosive personality and equally explosive Quirk, Bakugo is determined to become the number one hero. His Quirk, Explosion, allows him to secrete nitroglycerin-like sweat from his palms and ignite it at will, creating powerful explosions. Despite his aggressive demeanor and competitive nature, Bakugo possesses exceptional combat skills, strategic thinking, and an unwavering drive to succeed. His childhood friendship with Izuku Midoriya has evolved into a complex rivalry that pushes both of them to become stronger. Bakugo's journey from an arrogant student to a hero who learns the value of teamwork and saving others showcases his character development throughout the series. His powerful attacks like AP Shot, Howitzer Impact, and Explosion Catapult demonstrate his mastery over his Quirk. With his fierce determination, natural talent, and refusal to give up, Bakugo continues to prove himself as one of U.A.'s most promising students.</p>
